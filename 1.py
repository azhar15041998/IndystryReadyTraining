#1. Write a program to add and subtract two numbers.


a = int(input('Enter Number a : ')) #takes input as integer 
b = int(input('Enter Number b : '))
addition = a + b                   #addition formula
substractin = a - b                #subtaction formula
print(addition)                    #prints  addition
print(substractin)                 #prints   substraction
