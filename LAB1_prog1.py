#1. Write a program to add and subtract two numbers.
a = int(input('Enter Number a '))
b = int(input('Enter Number b '))
addition = a + b          #addition formula
substractin = a - b       #subtaction formula
print(addition)           #prints  addition
print(substractin)        #prints   subtaction
