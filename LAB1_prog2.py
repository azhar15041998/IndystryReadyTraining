#2. Write a program to multiply and divide two numbers.
a = int(input('Enter the  Number a :')) #takes input as integer 
b = int(input('Enter the  Number b :'))
mul = a * b  #Muliplies a and b
dev = a / b  #Devides a and b 
print(f'The multiplications of a and b is : {mul}, \nThe devision of a and b is : {dev}') #prins the values of multiplication and devision
